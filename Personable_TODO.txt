** KNOWN ERRORS TO FIX **
- Back button from EventsList is broken
- Putting Calendar object and checking for current date breaks the app
     *It seems that there are too many things happening in overlay service for my phone to accept it as a safe
      application. Try starting a secondary service that only checks for time and date then animating only on 
      Overlay service. This may solve problem below as well.
- Unable to open other services (such as keyboard) when overlay service is running

** UNFINISHED **
